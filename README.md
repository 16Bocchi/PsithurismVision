# Apple Vision Pro application for Meditation and relaxation

Psithurism is an immersive application that visualizes a growing and shrinking tree model based on real-time heart rate data from an Apple Watch. It integrates with Firebase to fetch the latest heart rate data and adjusts the tree's growth accordingly. The application also includes an ambient audio feature to enhance the user experience, and a breathing guide which displays herat rate conditions.

## Features
Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring: Fetches heart rate data from Firebase and displays it in a chart.
Tree Growth Visualization: A 3D tree model that grows or shrinks based on the user's heart rate.
Ambient Audio: Plays background audio to create a more immersive experience.
Cross Platform: Uses the Apple Watch to record and transmit realtime heart rate
